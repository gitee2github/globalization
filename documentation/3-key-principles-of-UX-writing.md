# The 3 Key Principles of UX Writing in Open Source Projects  

User experience (UX) writing is the art of crafting the texts that appear throughout the interface of digital products (websites, mobile apps, etc.). It matters when we write for our open source projects.  

Benefits of well written UX writing include:  

* Improved development experience    

* More people involved in your project    

* Reduced support costs

## Key Principle 1: Clear  

Keep it simple, stupid (KISS). Users understand what you talk about, the core message isn't blurred or complicated.  That means:  

* Be Specific  

* Concise  

* Avoid Jargon  

## Key Principle 2: Consistent  

Consistency breeds familiarity and familiarity promotes stickiness.  

If we can cultivate a consistent experience across the repositories of our open source project, including word usage and a similar tone for similar contexts, users will feel at ease with all the repositories.  

## Key Principle 3: Helpful  

For example, when we writing a README for our project, we need to answer at least the three questions:   

* What was your motivation?  
* Why did you build this project?  
* What problem does it solve?  

**For an open source project, consider our audience's likely background, goals, and current mood. A good UX writing will have more people use and contribute to our project.**
