# What Effective Documentation Matters for Open Source Software  

Providing an effective documentation system for open source software builds a strong, inclusive community and increases the usage of your software.  

Open source software provides a unique way to create effective documentation. Users are considered contributors and have access to the source code and documentation.  They are encouraged to submit additions, fix code, report errors, and update documentation.  Having more contributors can speed up the development of software and documentation.  

A good way to accelerate the usage of your software is to describe its advantages and demonstrate how to use it. There are many benefits of complete and accurate content. **Effective documentation can:**  

- Help to create an inclusive open source community  
- Build a user-oriented software product  
- Promote the usage of your software  
- Reduce users' learning cost  
- Reduce TCO  
- Improve user interaction  

On the opposite, **ineffective documentation may cause the following problems:**  

- Time waste  
- Software errors or even breakdowns  
- User churn  
- Increased software support costs  
- Shorter life span of your software

So you need to build an effective documentation system for your open source software.
