# Voice and Tone of openEuler Documentation

The openEuler developer community is built more than just code. Our voice and tone set developers' expectation for the efficient and valuable experiences, resources, and interactions that openEuler provides.    

## Conversational tone  

**Using a lighthearted, friendly tone** and offering specific suggestions for contributions can go a long way in making people feel welcomed and excited to participate in openEuler.   

For example,  

"Hi Judith, welcome to the openEuler Community. I'm the Bot here serving you."  

"First off, thank you for considering contributing to openEuler. Itâ€™s people like you that make openEuler such a great community."  

## Inclusive language

**Use simple language**, as many of our readers may not be native English speakers. Therefore,  

- Don't use idioms. Use more formal terms that are well defined.  

- Keep things brief, and avoid words and phrases that are vague or confusing.   

**All users and developers are welcomed** in the openEuler community. We're going to have people with diverse backgrounds. Therefore,  

- Don't use any terms that any group may feel offended.  
- Always use gender-neutral pronouns.  
- Don't assume people have prior knowledge about openEuler. Provide the basic knowledge needed to better understand openEuler.
