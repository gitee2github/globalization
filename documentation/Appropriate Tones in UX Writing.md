When writing a user- or developer-oriented copy, we should adjust the tone based on:

- The content type, or context  
- The user/developer's emotional state



To determine an appropriate tone, consider the following questions:  

- What situation is the reader in at the moment?  
- How do they likely feel right at the moment they are reading the text?  
- How is this content going to affect the reader?  
- How can I maintain the reader's state of mind or put them in a better tone?  



**Vary the tone to fit the situation:**

| Content Type                           | Reader's Emotional State          | Appropriate Tone                                             |
