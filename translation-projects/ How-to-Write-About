### How to write the "About" description of a project


"About" (简介) provides a brief introduction to the project. A good "About" is
clear, short, and to the point.

It may contain one or more of the following information items:

-   What the project is

-   What it does

-   Its core features

-   The technology it uses

-   Its positioning

For example,

-   iSulad is a light weight container runtime daemon which is designed for IOT
    and Cloud infrastructure.

-   A tool for writing better scripts

-   A Python Interpreter written in Rust

-   Powerful, fast, and an easy to use search engine

-   A bundle which aims to provide a full integration of MeilliSearch in Symfony

"About" can be a short, full sentence or a noun phrase. Choose the right style
based on the project characteristics.

When we choose to use a noun phrase, start it with an article when needed but do
not use a period (.) at the end.
