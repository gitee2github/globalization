# X-diagnosis

#### Introduction
X-diagnosis is a tool set for operating system development and operation & maintenance.  

The tool set includes the following tools:  

cpuload CPU flushing detection tool, which can accurately print out processes with high CPU usage within 1 second. It is very helpful for handling performance fluctuations.  

memtool glibc memory management tool, which is widely used but has limited debugging and fault locating methods. It can detect memory leaks in user-mode processes and collect memory distribution information in user-mode processes.  

oom_debug_info, which is a kernel module that can help maintainers find where the problem lies when the operating system encounters OOM.  

deadlock D, which is a process and deadlock checking mechanism.  

kernel_debug, which is a tool for accurately locating memory leaks in kernel modules. It is effective for the kernel's partner systems, memory managed by slab, LRU, and vmalloc.  

debug_log, which collects key system information when CPUs rush. It helps to locate faults.
