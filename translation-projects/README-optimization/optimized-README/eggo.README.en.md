# eggo

### Description
The Eggo project was designed to automate the deployment of K8S clusters in mass production environments, track deployment processes, and provide a high degree of flexibility. By combining GitOps management and deployment configuration tracking, cluster deployment is implemented in cloud native mode, enabling cluster management.

- Support multi-release version of Linux: such as openEuler/CentOS/Ubuntuï¼›
- Support multi-architecture deployment: a cluster supports nodes of multiple architectures(amd64/arm64);
- Support for multiple deployment modes: binary and KUbeadm (to be implemented);
- Support online and offline deployment, and cluster deployment using Gitops;

Currently, eggo implements the deployment using the command. The following are three deployment modes supported by eggo:


- Online deployment. Only need to write the `yaml` configuration file for the deployment. The required rpm package/binary file/plug-in/docker image are automatically downloaded online during the installation and deployment phase. Online deployment Currently, plug-ins cannot be downloaded and installed online. Plug-ins will be deployed online in the future. Details see [eggo operation manual](/docs/manual.md).
- Offline deployment. Package all rpm packages/binary files/plug-in/docker images into a `tar.gz` file in a certain format. Then write the corresponding `yaml` configuration file (details see [eggo operation manual](/docs/manual.md)), the cluster will be deployed by executing commands.  
- Deploy new clusters using meta-clusters through GitOps. The feature is still under development.
