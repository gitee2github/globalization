# Java-Packages

## Description

This repository serves as the entry repository for the Java SIG and is used as a repository for the openEuler community's Java packaging-related code, macros, tools, and guidelines. In addition, we identify packages to be maintained in the following categories:

1. Java build tool ontology packages, such as `maven` `gradle` `ant` and so on.
2. Java build tool-related derivative packages, such as `maven_local` and so on.
3. Java packages on which above Java build tool depends.
4. Java packages, and the Java packages on which they depend.
5. Java packages, and the specialized packages on which they depend (specifically to support the Java software).
