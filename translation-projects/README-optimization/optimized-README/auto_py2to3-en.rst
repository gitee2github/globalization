auto_py2to3
==========

On January 1, 2020, the Python 2 codebase was frozen. From that day on, there was no further porting of Python 2, which made the language and runtime environment obsolete.
Core developer Nick Coghlan explained in the FAQ, which ended "the core development team maintained Python 2 and 3 as reference interpreters for about 13 years."
The final version of Python 2 is currently in the beta testing and release candidate phase, and the final production version python 2.7.18 is expected to be released in April 2020.
Although most people in the Python community believe that Python needs urgent changes-especially since the much-needed Unicode support already exists.
But many people are frustrated that Python 2 code works well. Therefore, code migration is needed, and the ultimate goal of the library is to realize automated and fast code migration and provide automated testing.
In this process, although there may be some unsatisfactory aspects in the code migration process, the library will continue to be iterated and maintained.


Features
------------
* Testing setup with unit test and python setup.py test or pytest
* Command-line interface using Click

Architecture
------------

* Relying on the official 2to3 as a technical tool, encapsulating executable files for later use.
* Provide multiple functions through the command line to process project code.

Version Support
------------
* Python 2.x  to 3.x

* Linux: build/passing
* Windows: build/passing

Functions
------------
The main functions are as follows:

1. Determine whether to enable automatic conversion of Python2 code to Python3
2. Determine whether to keep the Python2 code backup
3. Determine whether to open the conversion code text comparison
4. Determine whether the version of the library that the project depends on is suitable for the current Python environment.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.x. and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
